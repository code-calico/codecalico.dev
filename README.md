# Code Calico

This repository hosts the GitHub page for our team! We plan to use it as a blog for open development.

## Contributor's Guide

The page is made using Astro, a static site generator powered by NodeJS. The `.astro` files use HTML to build pages, headed by 'frontmatter' which contains various samples of JavaScript code and metadata. The framework also supports Markdown/MDX and pure HTML.

Before contributing, we hope you have at least a basic understanding of the Astro project structure and building components in various JavaScript frontend frameworks. We also ask that you do not try to contribute new blog posts or content regarding the image of our team.

## Deployment Guide
Make sure your OS' `ansible-core` package is installed and your SSH key has been enrolled for deployments by Hazel. Use the command `make` to build the website and deploy it to the server.
